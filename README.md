## Restrictions for Jiawei

1. Jiawei will receive a penalty of 1 credit for each time she mentions breaking up.

2. Jiawei will receive a penalty of 5 credits for being very aggressive, even if Qirui has shown understanding and willingness to solve the problem. Jiawei must improve her emotion-control ability even in very bad situations. For example, she must not decline phone calls without explanation, disappear, or not let Qirui know her whereabouts during conflicts. Failure to do so will result in a penalty of 5 credits.

## Tentative Additions

The following rules are added by Qirui, but they only become effective after Jiawei approves them. These rules are open for discussion.

Add the following in attachment

> Purpose: The purpose of this rule is to share our evaluation and expectation of behavior of the others, which help us to maintain a relationship under each other's expectations. The quantifying credits are used to avoid the case where one feels his effort worth more than the true benefit experienced by the other. It maintains a balance of relationships.

> Expectation of Qirui: In some emergency situations, Qirui hopes Jiawei will try to control her harmful temper, but temper could still exist. Jiawei must not say harmful words to Qirui. If harmful words have been said, Qirui expects to tentatively charge Jiawei with 2 credits.

有时候感觉人生的意义是什么，或许我该多读书。
洗完澡后我又重新对我的课题产生兴趣，或许好奇心才是一剂良药。
我问chatGPT,人可以不生气吗，它说有的人可以，有的人可以控制。
但我想或许哥哥还能因为我的情绪而有压力也说明了他爱我，否则他也不必有不良反应。我会提高控制情绪的能力。
坦诚沟通和真诚理解才能解决问题。
我怀疑我最近痘痘这么肆虐是哥哥家的被子有问题。

我发现当我有情绪的时候，把想说的话写下来代替直接说对降低伤害有很大帮助。

0507 哥哥帮我分析课题的idea 对我很有帮助 我也喜欢哥哥讲故事：
我觉得哥哥关于作弊的做法其实很明智。保全了自己，然后恶人自然会收到应有的惩戒，只是不一定要哥哥去当这个恶人，这样让自己有了好名声也避免了潜在的威胁。哥哥似乎很懂运筹帷幄之道。
哥哥会接受我的意见改变自己，真好，我也要变得更好，改善脾气
