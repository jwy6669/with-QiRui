Add the following in attachment

> Purpose: The purpose of this rule is to share our evaluation and expectation of behavior of the others, which help us to maintain a relationship under each other's expectations. The quantifying credits are used to avoid the case where one feels his effort worth more than the true benefit experienced by the other. It maintains a balance of relationships.

> Expectation of Qirui: In some emergency situations, Qirui hopes Jiawei will try to control her harmful temper, but temper could still exist. Jiawei must not say harmful words to Qirui. If harmful words have been said, Qirui expects to tentatively charge Jiawei with 2 credits.

有时候感觉人生的意义是什么，或许我该多读书。
洗完澡后我又重新对我的课题产生兴趣，或许好奇心才是一剂良药。
我问chatGPT,人可以不生气吗，它说有的人可以，有的人可以控制。
但我想或许哥哥还能因为我的情绪而有压力也说明了他爱我，否则他也不必有不良反应。我会提高控制情绪的能力。
坦诚沟通和真诚理解才能解决问题。
我怀疑我最近痘痘这么肆虐是哥哥家的被子有问题。

我发现当我有情绪的时候，把想说的话写下来代替直接说对降低伤害有很大帮助。
