# Rules for Jiawei and Qirui's Relationship

## Restrictions for Qirui

1. All communication with ex-partners must be reported to Jiawei within 168 hours. Failure to do so will result in a penalty of 70 credits.

2. Qirui must seek permission from Jiawei before initiating any active helpings, such as initial requests, where the initial talker is the first person to communicate after 24 hours of inactivity by the other person. Failure to do so will result in a penalty of 100-300 credits.

## Restrictions for Jiawei

1. Jiawei will receive a penalty of 1 credit for each time she mentions breaking up.

2. Jiawei will receive a penalty of 5 credits for being very aggressive, even if Qirui has shown understanding and willingness to solve the problem. Jiawei must improve her emotion-control ability even in very bad situations. For example, she must not decline phone calls without explanation, disappear, or not let Qirui know her whereabouts during conflicts. Failure to do so will result in a penalty of 5 credits.

## Tentative Additions

The following rules are added by Qirui, but they only become effective after Jiawei approves them. These rules are open for discussion.

Add the following in attachment

> Purpose: The purpose of this rule is to share our evaluation and expectation of behavior of the others, which help us to maintain a relationship under each other's expectations. The quantifying credits are used to avoid the case where one feels his effort worth more than the true benefit experienced by the other. It maintains a balance of relationships.

> Expectation of Qirui: In some emergency situations, Qirui hopes Jiawei will try to control her harmful temper, but temper could still exist. Jiawei must not say harmful words to Qirui. If harmful words have been said, Qirui expects to tentatively charge Jiawei with 2 credits.
